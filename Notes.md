# Monolith vs Microservices: Deep Architectural Differences

## Monolithic Architecture

- **Structure:** Single codebase; all features (UI, business logic, data access) tightly coupled and deployed together.
- **Database:** One centralized database.
- **Deployment:** Any change requires redeploying the whole application.
- **Tech Stack:** Typically the same stack for all components.
- **Communication:** Internal function calls within the same process.
- **Failure Handling:** A bug in any part can crash the entire system.

## Microservices Architecture

- **Structure:** Application split into independent services, each with its own codebase and database.
- **Database:** Each service may use its own database.
- **Deployment:** Services deployed independently; updating one does not affect others.
- **Tech Stack:** Different technologies can be used for different services.
- **Communication:** Services communicate via APIs or messaging queues.
- **Failure Handling:** Fault isolation; issues in one service do not affect others.

## Companies Using Monolith and Microservices (2025)

- **Netflix:** Transitioned from monolith to microservices for scalability and rapid deployments.
- **Square Payroll:** Migrated for improved scaling and workflow transparency.
- **Traditional Banks:** Often use monolithic systems for legacy core banking, modernizing incrementally.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Many organizations use a mixâ€”core features as monolith, peripheral features as microservices.

## Simple Example: E-commerce Platform

| Feature         | Monolithic Example                          | Microservices Example                       |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| User Auth       | Single user auth logic in main app          | Separate user-auth service                  |
| Product Catalog | Managed in same code/database as rest of app| Own microservice with own database          |
| Shopping Cart   | Module within main app                      | Dedicated shopping-cart service             |
| Payment Gateway | Logic in main codebase                      | Separate payment service with 3rd-party APIs|
| Deployment      | All features deployed at once               | Each service deployed/updated individually  |
| Scenario        | Small business, quick launch                | Large-scale retailer, high traffic, many teams|

## Pros and Cons

### Monolithic

**Pros**
- Easier to develop, test, and deploy initially.
- Lower initial investment and simpler debugging.

**Cons**
- Difficult to scale efficiently.
- Hard to adopt new technologies in one part.
- Any bug can impact the entire system.
- Limited flexibility; tightly coupled components.
- Performance and deployment risk increase as codebase grows.

### Microservices

**Pros**
- High scalability; scale only the needed service.
- Flexibility in technology choices.
- Fault tolerance; isolated failures.
- Easier integration of new tech/services.
- Teams can work in parallel.

**Cons**
- Increased complexity and operational costs.
- Network communication overhead and latency.
- More resources needed for orchestration and management.
- Harder testing and debugging across services.
- Complex deployment pipelines and dependencies.



## Client-Side vs Server-Side Architecture

### Client-Side Architecture

- **Definition:** Logic and rendering handled primarily in the user's browser or device.
- **Technologies:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue).
- **Data Flow:** Fetches data from server APIs, processes and displays it locally.
- **Deployment:** Static assets (HTML, JS, CSS) served via CDN or web server.
- **Performance:** Fast UI updates; depends on client device capabilities.
- **Security:** Vulnerable to code exposure and client-side attacks (XSS).
- **Use Cases:** Single Page Applications (SPAs), interactive dashboards, real-time UIs.

### Server-Side Architecture

- **Definition:** Core logic, data processing, and rendering handled on the server.
- **Technologies:** Node.js, Python (Django, Flask), Java (Spring), PHP, Ruby on Rails.
- **Data Flow:** Server receives requests, processes data, and sends rendered HTML or API responses.
- **Deployment:** Application hosted on web servers; clients receive processed output.
- **Performance:** Centralized processing; less dependent on client device.
- **Security:** Sensitive logic and data remain on server; easier to enforce access controls.
- **Use Cases:** Traditional websites, REST APIs, secure data processing, multi-user systems.

## TCP/IP vs OSI Model: Full Details

### OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven distinct layers.

| Layer | Name                | Function                                                                                  | Examples                       |
|-------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 7     | Application         | User-facing protocols and interfaces (email, web, file transfer)                         | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS           |
| 6     | Presentation        | Data translation, encryption, compression                                                | SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII           |
| 5     | Session             | Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions                                            | NetBIOS, RPC                   |
| 4     | Transport           | Reliable data transfer, error recovery, flow control                                     | TCP, UDP                       |
| 3     | Network             | Routing, addressing, packet forwarding                                                   | IP, ICMP, ARP                  |
| 2     | Data Link           | Framing, MAC addressing, error detection/correction                                      | Ethernet, PPP, Switches        |
| 1     | Physical            | Transmission of raw bits over physical medium                                            | Cables, Hubs, Fiber, Wi-Fi     |

**Key Points:**
- Each layer serves the layer above and is served by the layer below.
- Strict separation of concerns; ideal for teaching and troubleshooting.
- Not all protocols map perfectly to OSI layers in practice.

### TCP/IP Model (Internet Protocol Suite)

The TCP/IP model is the foundation of the modern internet, with four layers that map to real-world protocols.

| Layer         | Function                                   | OSI Equivalent                | Examples                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Application   | Network processes to applications          | OSI Layers 5-7                | HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS      |
| Transport     | Host-to-host communication, reliability    | OSI Layer 4                   | TCP, UDP                  |
| Internet      | Routing, addressing, packet forwarding     | OSI Layer 3                   | IP, ICMP, ARP             |
| Network Access| Physical transmission, data link           | OSI Layers 1-2                | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP      |

**Key Points:**
- More practical and widely used than OSI.
- Protocols are defined for each layer.
- Layers are less strictly separated than OSI.

### How Data Flows (Example: Sending an Email)

1. **Application Layer:** User writes email (SMTP).
2. **Presentation Layer (OSI):** Data encrypted (TLS).
3. **Session Layer (OSI):** Session established.
4. **Transport Layer:** Data segmented, reliability ensured (TCP).
5. **Network Layer:** Data routed across networks (IP).
6. **Data Link Layer:** Frames prepared for transmission (Ethernet).
7. **Physical Layer:** Bits sent over cable/wireless.

In TCP/IP, steps 2 and 3 are handled within the Application layer.

---

### Summary

- **OSI Model:** 7 layers, theoretical, used for understanding and troubleshooting.
- **TCP/IP Model:** 4 layers, practical, basis for the internet.
- **Both models:** Help standardize networking, but TCP/IP is used in real-world systems.
